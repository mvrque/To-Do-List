To-Do List - CRUD application

Simple To-Do List where client can add a task to be done. Tasks can be marked completed, back to uncompleted and also deleted.

Tech used: 
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, express, MongoDB.

How It's Made: 
    The back-end development was made with NodeJS and express. Application is connected to MongoDB where all data is stored. Marking it completed or deleting it, also changes the database.

    Adding MVC to the application and also changing the design when it's ready!

What i learned: 
    Learned more about how to use NodeJS, express, EJS and mongoDB. 
    I learned how to create, read, update and delete data from database. Also used .gitignore for stuff that doesn't need to be pushed to github.
